  abstract  = {We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multi-relational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

@article{Fernandez2011,
  abstract = {Currently, techniques for content description and query processing in Information Retrieval (IR) are based on keywords, and therefore provide limited capabilities to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Aiming to solve the limitations of keyword-based models, the idea of conceptual search, understood as searching by meanings rather than literal strings, has been the focus of a wide body of research in the IR field. More recently, it has been used as a prototypical scenario (or even envisioned as a potential "killer app") in the Semantic Web (SW) vision, since its emergence in the late nineties. However, current approaches to semantic search developed in the SW area have not yet taken full advantage of the acquired knowledge, accumulated experience, and technological sophistication achieved through several decades of work in the IR field. Starting from this position, this work investigates the definition of an ontology-based IR model, oriented to the exploitation of domain Knowledge Bases to support semantic search capabilities in large document repositories, stressing on the one hand the use of fully fledged ontologies in the semantic-based perspective, and on the other hand the consideration of unstructured content as the target search space. The major contribution of this work is an innovative, comprehensive semantic search model, which extends the classic IR model, addresses the challenges of the massive and heterogeneous Web environment, and integrates the benefits of both keyword and semantic-based search. Additional contributions include: an innovative rank fusion technique that minimizes the undesired effects of knowledge sparseness on the yet juvenile SW, and the creation of a large-scale evaluation benchmark, based on TREC IR evaluation standards, which allows a rigorous comparison between IR and SW approaches. Conducted experiments show that our semantic search model obtained comparable and better performance results (in terms of MAP and P@10 values) than the best TREC automatic system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We describe Cypher 9, which is the first version of the language governed by the openCypher Implementers Group. We first introduce the language by example, and describe its uses in industry. We then provide a formal semantic definition of the core read-query features of Cypher, including its variant of the property graph data model, and its "ASCII Art" graph pattern matching mechanism for expressing subgraphs of interest to an application. We compare the features of Cypher to other property graph query languages, and describe extensions, at an advanced stage of development, which will form part of Cypher 10, turning the language into a compositional language which supports graph projections and multiple named graphs.},

  abstract = {Knowledge base question answering (KBQA)is an important task in Natural Language Processing. Existing approaches face significant challenges including complex question understanding, necessity for reasoning, and lack of large end-to-end training datasets. In this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Question Answering (NSQA), a modular KBQA system, that leverages (1) Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parses for task-independent question understanding; (2) a simple yet effective graph transformation approach to convert AMR parses into candidate logical queries that are aligned to the KB; (3) a pipeline-based approach which integrates multiple, reusable modules that are trained specifically for their individual tasks (semantic parser, entity andrelationship linkers, and neuro-symbolic reasoner) and do not require end-to-end training data. NSQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on two prominent KBQA datasets based on DBpedia (QALD-9 and LC-QuAD1.0). Furthermore, our analysis emphasizes that AMR is a powerful tool for KBQA systems.},

In this paper, we distinguish between collaboration at different levels and show that inter-institutional and international collaboration need not necessarily involve inter-individual collaboration. We also show that co-authorship is no more than a partial indicator of collaboration. Lastly, we argue for a more symmetrical approach in comparing the costs of collaboration with the undoubted benefits when considering policies towards research collaboration.}

  abstract  = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have rapidly emerged as an important area in AI over the last ten years. Building on a storied tradition of graphs in the AI community, a KG may be simply defined as a directed, labeled, multi-relational graph with some form of semantics. In part, this has been fueled by increased publication of structured datasets on the Web, and well-publicized successes of large-scale projects such as the Google Knowledge Graph and the Amazon Product Graph. However, another factor that is less discussed, but which has been equally instrumental in the success of KGs, is the cross-disciplinary nature of academic KG research. Arguably, because of the diversity of this research, a synthesis of how different KG research strands all tie together could serve a useful role in enabling more ‘moonshot' research and large-scale collaborations. This review of the KG research landscape attempts to provide such a synthesis by first showing what the major strands of research are, and how those strands map to different communities, such as Natural Language Processing, Databases and Semantic Web. A unified framework is suggested in which to view the distinct, but overlapping, foci of KG research within these communities.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments , we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and rela-tional fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.

While Google coined the term Knowledge Graph in 2012, there are also a few openly available knowledge graphs, with DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase being among the most prominent ones. Those graphs are often constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods. The result are large-scale knowledge graphs that try to make a good trade-off between completeness and correctness. In order to further increase the utility of such knowledge graphs, various refinement methods have been proposed, which try to infer and add missing knowledge to the graph, or identify erroneous pieces of information. In this article, we provide a survey of such knowledge graph refinement approaches, with a dual look at both the methods being proposed as well as the evaluation methodologies used.},

  abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have significantly enhanced educational accessibility by offering a wide variety of courses and breaking down traditional barriers related to geography, finance, and time. However, students often face difficulties navigating the vast selection of courses, especially when exploring new fields of study. Driven by this challenge, researchers have been exploring course recommender systems to offer tailored guidance that aligns with individual learning preferences and career aspirations. These systems face particular challenges in effectively addressing the ``cold start'' problem for new users. Recent advancements in recommender systems suggest integrating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation process to enhance personalized recommendations and address the ``cold start'' problem. Motivated by these advancements, our study introduces RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs), a system specifically designed to overcome the ``cold start'' challenges of traditional course recommender systems. The RAMO system leverages the capabilities of LLMs, along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-facilitated contextual understanding, to provide course recommendations through a conversational interface, aiming to enhance the e-learning experience.},

  abstract = {Various research areas at the intersection of computer and social sciences require a ground truth of contextualized claims labelled with their truth values in order to facilitate supervision, validation or reproducibility of approaches dealing, for example, with fact-checking or analysis of societal debates. So far, no reasonably large, up-to-date and queryable corpus of structured information about claims and related metadata is publicly available. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce ClaimsKG, a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata. ClaimsKG is generated through a semi-automated pipeline, which harvests data from popular fact-checking websites on a regular basis, annotates claims with related entities from DBpedia, and lifts the data to RDF using an RDF/S model that makes use of established vocabularies. In order to harmonise data originating from diverse fact-checking sites, we introduce normalised ratings as well as a simple claims coreference resolution strategy. The current knowledge graph, extensible to new information, consists of 28,383 claims published since 1996, amounting to 6,606,032 triples.},

  abstract = {This paper is intended to serve as a comprehensive introduction to the emerging geld concerned with the design and use of ontologies. We observe that disparate backgrounds, languages, tools, and techniques are a major barrier to eeective communication among people, organisations, and/or software systems. We show how the development and implementation of an explicit account of a shared understanding (i.e. anòntology') in a given subject area, can improve such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greater reuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software. After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purposes they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, rst discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing deenitions. We then consider the beneets of and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the speciication, implementation and evaluation of ontologies. Finally, we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging geld, considering various case studies, software tools for ontology development, key research issues and future prospects.},

  abstract = {We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive , one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.},

It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-The-Arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-The-Art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-Temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

In this work, we propose a new model, QA-GNN, which addresses the above challenges through two key innovations: (i) relevance scoring, where we use LMs to estimate the importance of KG nodes relative to the given QA context, and (ii) joint reasoning, where we connect the QA context and KG to form a joint graph, and mutually update their representations through graph neural networks. We evaluate our model on QA benchmarks in the commonsense (CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA) and biomedical (MedQA-USMLE) domains. QA-GNN outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models, and exhibits capabilities to perform interpretable and structured reasoning, e.g., correctly handling negation in questions.},

Nevertheless, finding suitable scholars and researchers to work with is challenging and, mostly, time-consuming for many.

In this work, we utilized a life science and biomedical research database, i.e., MEDLINE, to develop a collaboration recommendation system based on novel graph neural networks, i.e., GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Network, which can capture intrinsic, complex, and changing dependencies among researchers, including temporal user–user interactions. The baseline methods based on LightGCN and gradient boosting trees were also developed in this work for comparison. Internal automatic evaluations and external evaluations through end-users' ratings were conducted, and the results revealed that our graph neural networks recommender exhibits consistently encouraging results.},

Although knowledge graphs have already supported multiple "Big Data" applications in all sorts of commercial and scientific domains since Google coined this term in 2012, there was no previous study give a systemically review of the application of knowledge graphs. Therefore, unlike other related work which focuses on the construction techniques of knowledge graphs, this present paper aims at providing a first survey on these applications stemming from different domains.
