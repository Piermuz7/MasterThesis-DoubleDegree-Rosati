We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries. © 2009 ACM.},

So far, no reasonably large, up-to-date and queryable corpus of structured information about claims and related metadata is publicly available. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce ClaimsKG, a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata. ClaimsKG is generated through a semi-automated pipeline, which harvests data from popular fact-checking websites on a regular basis, annotates claims with related entities from DBpedia, and lifts the data to RDF using an RDF/S model that makes use of established vocabularies. In order to harmonise data originating from diverse fact-checking sites, we introduce normalised ratings as well as a simple claims coreference resolution strategy. The current knowledge graph, extensible to new information, consists of 28,383 claims published since 1996, amounting to 6,606,032 triples.},

   abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs), representing facts as triples, have been widely adopted in many applications. Reasoning tasks such as link prediction and rule induction are important for the development of KGs. Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) embedding entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces, have been proposed for these reasoning tasks and proven to be efficient and robust. But the plausibility and feasibility of applying and deploying KGEs in real-work applications has not been well-explored. In this paper, we discuss and report our experiences of deploying KGEs in a real domain application: e-commerce. We first identity three important desiderata for e-commerce KG systems: 1) attentive reasoning, reasoning over a few target relations of more concerns instead of all; 2) explanation, providing explanations for a prediction to help both users and business operators understand why the prediction is made; 3) transferable rules, generating reusable rules to accelerate the deployment of a KG to new systems. While non existing KGE could meet all these desiderata, we propose a novel one, an explainable knowledge graph attention network that make prediction through modeling correlations between triples rather than purely relying on its head entity, relation and tail entity embeddings. It could automatically selects attentive triples for prediction and records the contribution of them at the same time, from which explanations could be easily provided and transferable rules could be efficiently produced. We empirically show that our method is capable of meeting all three desiderata in our e-commerce application and outperform typical baselines on datasets from real domain applications.},

In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-The-Arts but also those with latest trends.

In this work, we propose a new model, QA-GNN, which addresses the above challenges through two key innovations: (i) relevance scoring, where we use LMs to estimate the importance of KG nodes relative to the given QA context, and (ii) joint reasoning, where we connect the QA context and KG to form a joint graph, and mutually update their representations through graph neural networks. We evaluate our model on QA benchmarks in the commonsense (CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA) and biomedical (MedQA-USMLE) domains.

   abstract = {Currently, techniques for content description and query processing in Information Retrieval (IR) are based on keywords, and therefore provide limited capabilities to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Aiming to solve the limitations of keyword-based models, the idea of conceptual search, understood as searching by meanings rather than literal strings, has been the focus of a wide body of research in the IR field. More recently, it has been used as a prototypical scenario (or even envisioned as a potential "killer app") in the Semantic Web (SW) vision, since its emergence in the late nineties. However, current approaches to semantic search developed in the SW area have not yet taken full advantage of the acquired knowledge, accumulated experience, and technological sophistication achieved through several decades of work in the IR field. Starting from this position, this work investigates the definition of an ontology-based IR model, oriented to the exploitation of domain Knowledge Bases to support semantic search capabilities in large document repositories, stressing on the one hand the use of fully fledged ontologies in the semantic-based perspective, and on the other hand the consideration of unstructured content as the target search space. The major contribution of this work is an innovative, comprehensive semantic search model, which extends the classic IR model, addresses the challenges of the massive and heterogeneous Web environment, and integrates the benefits of both keyword and semantic-based search. Additional contributions include: an innovative rank fusion technique that minimizes the undesired effects of knowledge sparseness on the yet juvenile SW, and the creation of a large-scale evaluation benchmark, based on TREC IR evaluation standards, which allows a rigorous comparison between IR and SW approaches. Conducted experiments show that our semantic search model obtained comparable and better performance results (in terms of MAP and P@10 values) than the best TREC automatic system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In part, this has been fueled by increased publication of structured datasets on the Web, and well-publicized successes of large-scale projects such as the Google Knowledge Graph and the Amazon Product Graph. However, another factor that is less discussed, but which has been equally instrumental in the success of KGs, is the cross-disciplinary nature of academic KG research. Arguably, because of the diversity of this research, a synthesis of how different KG research strands all tie together could serve a useful role in enabling more ‘moonshot' research and large-scale collaborations. This review of the KG research landscape attempts to provide such a synthesis by first showing what the major strands of research are, and how those strands map to different communities, such as Natural Language Processing, Databases and Semantic Web.

TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive , one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.},

   abstract = {Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments , we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and rela-tional fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.

   abstract = {Abstract Purpose Based on real-world academic data, this study aims to use network embedding technology to mining academic relationships, and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed embedding model on academic collaborator recommendation tasks. Design/methodology/approach We propose an academic collaborator recommendation model based on attributed network embedding (ACR-ANE), which can get enhanced scholar embedding and take full advantage of the topological structure of the network and multi-type scholar attributes. The non-local neighbors for scholars are defined to capture strong relationships among scholars. A deep auto-encoder is adopted to encode the academic collaboration network structure and scholar attributes into a low-dimensional representation space. Findings 1. The proposed non-local neighbors can better describe the relationships among scholars in the real world than the first-order neighbors. 2. It is important to consider the structure of the academic collaboration network and scholar attributes when recommending collaborators for scholars simultaneously. Research limitations The designed method works for static networks, without taking account of the network dynamics. Practical implications The designed model is embedded in academic collaboration network structure and scholarly attributes, which can be used to help scholars recommend potential collaborators. Originality/value Experiments on two real-world scholarly datasets, Aminer and APS, show that our proposed method performs better than other baselines.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study is to present an exhaustive analysis on research paper recommender systems which have become very popular and gained a lot of research attention. Though the major focus is on developing new recommendation algorithms, other research dimensions are left untouched. Renown recommendation classes include content-based approaches, collaborative filtering, link-based algorithms, co-occurrence based approaches, global relevance and hybrid methods. These approaches mainly differ in background knowledge and modes of user behavior analysis. For instance, content-based filtering uses paper descriptions which are mostly word-based features. Collaborative filtering makes predictions based on peers’ interests. Link-based algorithms utilize academic associations that exist between different entities in academia. Co-occurrence based techniques incorporate event occurrences to locate related papers. Global relevance adopts a ‘one-for-all’ policy for recommending popular articles. Hybrid methods combine the above approaches to design efficient algorithms. We have reviewed articles implementing several versions of these classes, however minor customizations make it difficult to categorize the new methods to one of the base classes. We have defined the concept of ‘background knowledge and operating principle’ for proper classification and to make a clear distinction among the recommendation approaches. We have used a combination of systematic literature review, critical review, and conceptual review to conduct this survey which presents current advancements in the field and discusses popular recommendation approaches. This paper reveals the factors affecting users’ behavior and introduces a taxonomy of knowledge acquisition sources. Moreover, various evaluation methods and important performance criteria are explored. Finally, this paper examines the research trends and reports major loopholes in current research to foster the development of efficacious recommender systems.},

   abstract = {A scholarly recommendation system is an important tool for identifying prior and related resources such as literature, datasets, grants, and collaborators. A well-designed scholarly recommender significantly saves the time of researchers and can provide information that would not otherwise be considered. The usefulness of scholarly recommendations, especially literature recommendations, has been established by the widespread acceptance of web search engines such as CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. This article discusses different aspects and developments of scholarly recommendation systems. We searched the ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEE Explorer, and Scopus for publications in the domain of scholarly recommendations for literature, collaborators, reviewers, conferences and journals, datasets, and grant funding. In total, 225 publications were identified in these areas. We discuss methodologies used to develop scholarly recommender systems. Content-based filtering is the most commonly applied technique, whereas collaborative filtering is more popular among conference recommenders. The implementation of deep learning algorithms in scholarly recommendation systems is rare among the screened publications. We found fewer publications in the areas of the dataset and grant funding recommenders than in other areas. Furthermore, studies analyzing users’ feedback to improve scholarly recommendation systems are rare for recommenders. This survey provides background knowledge regarding existing research on scholarly recommenders and aids in developing future recommendation systems in this domain.},

Drawing from two micro-oriented approaches (i.e., club theory and commons theory) and relying on self-governance as the basic principle for addressing collaboration problems, we aim to develop theoretically informed, concise and generalizable catalogs of problems and solutions based on the experiences and expectations of research collaboration participants. A series of expert interviews (N = 18) were conducted with leading researchers in Germany. Seven typical problems (e.g., lack of commitment or fairness) and 12 possible solutions (e.g., continuous evaluation or creating cognitive common ground) that can be applied within the self-regulatory framework were identified. The results provide a useful framework to further investigate problems and solutions as well as interlinkages between the two, and to improve research collaboration.},

In this paper, we distinguish between collaboration at different levels and show that inter-institutional and international collaboration need not necessarily involve inter-individual collaboration. We also show that co-authorship is no more than a partial indicator of collaboration. Lastly, we argue for a more symmetrical approach in comparing the costs of collaboration with the undoubted benefits when considering policies towards research collaboration.}

abstract={ With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an indispensable and important component, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems, these DNN-based methods still exhibit some limitations, such as inferior capabilities to effectively capture textual side information about users and items, difficulties in generalization to various recommendation scenarios, and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning skills. As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems. Therefore, in this survey, we comprehensively review LLM-empowered recommender systems from various perspectives including pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting paradigms. More specifically, we first introduce the representative methods to learn user and item representations, leveraging LLMs as feature encoders. Then, we systematically review the emerging advanced techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the promising future directions in this emerging field. },

abstract = {The collaborative filtering (CF) approach in recommender systems assumes that users' preferences are consistent among users. Although accurate, this approach fails on some users. We presume that some of these users belong to a small community of users who have unusual preferences, such users are not compliant with the CF underlying assumption. They are grey sheep users. This paper aims at accurately identifying grey sheep users. We introduce a new distribution-based grey sheep users identification technique, that borrows from outlier detection and from information retrieval, while taking into account the specificities of preference data on which CF relies: extreme sparsity, imprecision and users' bias. The experimental evaluation conducted on a state-of-the-art dataset shows that this new distribution-based technique outperforms state-of-the-art grey sheep users identification techniques.},

However, deep generative models now have the capability to model and sample from complex data distributions, including user-item interactions, text, images, and videos, enabling novel recommendation tasks. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey connects key advancements in RS using Generative Models (Gen-RecSys), covering: interaction-driven generative models; the use of large language models (LLM) and textual data for natural language recommendation; and the integration of multimodal models for generating and processing images/videos in RS. Our work highlights necessary paradigms for evaluating the impact and harm of Gen-RecSys and identifies open challenges.

   abstract = {Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) have traditionally focused on providing personalized travel suggestions, often prioritizing user preferences without considering broader sustainability goals. Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase. This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals. Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.},

   abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have significantly enhanced educational accessibility by offering a wide variety of courses and breaking down traditional barriers related to geography, finance, and time. However, students often face difficulties navigating the vast selection of courses, especially when exploring new fields of study. Driven by this challenge, researchers have been exploring course recommender systems to offer tailored guidance that aligns with individual learning preferences and career aspirations. These systems face particular challenges in effectively addressing the ``cold start'' problem for new users. Recent advancements in recommender systems suggest integrating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation process to enhance personalized recommendations and address the ``cold start'' problem. Motivated by these advancements, our study introduces RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs), a system specifically designed to overcome the ``cold start'' challenges of traditional course recommender systems. The RAMO system leverages the capabilities of LLMs, along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-facilitated contextual understanding, to provide course recommendations through a conversational interface, aiming to enhance the e-learning experience.},
