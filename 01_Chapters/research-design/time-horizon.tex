This layer of the research onion focuses on the research's time horizon, distinguishing between longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches \cite{SaundersMark2023}.
Longitudinal research extends over an extended period, capturing multiple snapshots throughout the study.
In contrast, a cross-sectional approach examines a single snapshot within a specific, typically shorter, timeframe.
Given time constraints, this thesis adopts a cross-sectional time horizon, namely the duration of the thesis development.
