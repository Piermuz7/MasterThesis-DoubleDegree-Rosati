The third layer of the research onion is the methodological choice, which refers to the specific techniques and procedures used to collect and analyze data.
According to \textcite{SaundersMark2023}, the methodological choice is influenced by the research philosophy and approach.

Research can be conducted using either a quantitative or qualitative approach, depending on the objectives pursued.
Quantitative research is primarily concerned with hypothesis testing through a deductive approach or pattern discovery when adopting an inductive perspective.
In both cases, the analysis relies on a large volume of data to ensure statistical significance.
In contrast, qualitative research focuses on smaller datasets, aiming to capture the underlying characteristics and contextual nuances within them.

This thesis use a qualitative research approach, as the primary goal is to understand the research domain and the challenges faced by researchers in finding collaborators.
