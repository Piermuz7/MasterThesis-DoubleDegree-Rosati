\chapter{Literature Review}\label{chap:literature-review}
As part of the problem awareness phase, the literature review summarises the relevant scientific literature related to the topics of this thesis.
It lays the groundwork for answering to the research questions.
The literature reviews on \acrlongpl{kg} (see Section \ref{sec:knowledge-graphs}), \acrlongpl{gnn} (see Section \ref{sec:graph-neural-networks}), and \acrlongpl{bems} (see Section \ref{sec:building-energy-management-systems}) are described and illustrated below.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:related-work} illustrates works related to that of this thesis while the research gap is reported in Section \ref{sec:research-gap}.
