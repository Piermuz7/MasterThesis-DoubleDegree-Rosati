\chapter{Literature Review}\label{chap:literature-review}

As part of the problem awareness phase, the literature review summarises the relevant scientific literature related to the topics of this thesis.
It lays the groundwork for answering to the research questions.
Initially, Sec.~\ref{sec:research-collaboration} discusses the definition and importance of research collaboration and methods for finding potential research collaborators.
Sec.~\ref{sec:knowledge-graphs} provides an overview of knowledge graphs, from theoretical aspects to real-world applications.
Existing knowledge graphs and ontologies in the research field are also described.
Sec.~\ref{sec:large-language-models} briefly provides an overview of \glspl{llm}, applications of these technologies with their advantages and limitations.
Finally, Sec.~\ref{sec:recommender-systems} explains recommendation systems, particularly existing recommendation systems in the search domain and \gls{rag}-based recommendation systems.
