In the Suggestions phase, we address the second sub-research question:
\begin{center}
    ``\textit{How can a \gls{kg} and \gls{llm}-based system be designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information from large, heterogeneous data sources to support personalized recommendations?}''
\end{center}

\glspl{llm} combined with \gls{rag} offer a promising solution by improving explainability, reducing hallucinations, and integrating external knowledge sources.
While this combination has demonstrated improvements in recommendation accuracy and contextual relevance, its application in research collaborators' recommendations remains little explored.
This presents an opportunity to bridge the gap by developing a more transparent, adaptable and knowledge-enriched recommendation framework suitable for academic collaborations.
