\subsection*{The EURIO Knowledge Graph}
The \gls{eurio} \acrlong{kg} \cite{CORDIS_EURIO_2022} is built upon \gls{cordis} data and serves as a structured \gls{kg} that encapsulates information about research projects funded under the \gls{fp7} and \gls{h2020} framework programmes.
The \gls{eurio} \gls{kg} can be accessed via a \gls{sparql} endpoint at \url{https://cordis.europa.eu/datalab/sparql-endpoint/en}.
The \gls{kg} provides both database dumps and subsets of \gls{eurio} data in the form of named graphs.
The structure and organization of these named graphs are defined by the \gls{eurio} ontology, which is publicly available at: \url{https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/eurio}.
