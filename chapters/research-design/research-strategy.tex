The research strategy defines how the research goal is to be achieved \cite{SaundersMark2023}.
This aspect of the research design is crucial as it outlines the steps to be taken to address the research questions effectively.
Several research strategies have been defined including: Experiment, Survey, Case study, Action research, Grounded theory, Ethnography and Archival research.
Each of these strategies is designed with a specific purpose in mind and is best suited to achieving the intended research objective.

Since the primary goal of this thesis is to design and develop an artefact, the research strategy used is the \gls{dsr} \cite{Hevner2010}.
\gls{dsr} is a research methodology that focuses on what is called ``relevance'', which is the creation and evaluation of an artifact to solve complex real-world problems.
Moreover, the research should enhance the existing body of knowledge, a principle referred to as ``rigor''.
This duality emerges from the fundamental idea that \gls{dsr} combines two distinct research paradigms: behavioral science and design science, each serving unique objectives to achieve the overall research goals.
A proposed Information Systems Research framework (Fig.~\ref{fig:information-system-research-framework}) illustrates this dual nature, emphasizing the necessity of addressing both a practical business need and the application of relevant knowledge in the research process.

\end{figure}

As already mentioned, the \gls{dsr} focuses on the creation and evaluation of an artifact to solve complex real-world problems.
The \gls{dsr} process is iterative, involving multiple cycles of development and evaluation, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:design-science-research-cycles}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

On the right side, the Rigor Cycle focuses on existing knowledge, incorporating theories, methodologies, and expert experiences.
In the context of this thesis, it represents the literature review.
On the left side, the Relevance Cycle highlights the application domain, encompassing the people, organizations, systems, and the challenges or opportunities they face.
At the center, there is the Design Cycle, which addresses research through the development and evaluation of the artifact.
These three components are interconnected, forming a continuous \gls{dsr} cycle that ensures the integration of knowledge, practical relevance, and iterative refinement.

According to \textcite{Hevner2010}, the \gls{dsr} is defined in five process steps: awareness of problem, suggestion, development, evaluation, and conclusion.
\textcite{Hevner2010} modified a framework originally proposed by \textcite{Vaishnavi2007}, illustrating the five process steps along with the expected outputs and knowledge flows, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:design-science-research-framework}.

The research of this thesis will follow the \gls{dsr} methodology, in accordance with the five steps of the framework proposed by \textcite{Hevner2010}.

The Awareness Phase involves researchers identifying and recognizing a specific problem or opportunity that requires attention.
During this initial stage, they gain a clear understanding of existing challenges or gaps in current systems or processes, laying the groundwork for the subsequent phases of the design cycle.

In the Suggestion Phase, researchers propose potential solutions to address the identified problem or opportunity.
This stage focuses on generating innovative ideas and design concepts that serve as the foundation for developing artifacts aimed at resolving the issue.

The Development Phase is where researchers build and implement the designed artifacts or solutions based on the proposals from previous phases.
This stage transforms conceptual designs into functional prototypes, bringing the ideas to life.

During the Evaluation Phase of \gls{dsr}, researchers analyze and assess the developed artifacts to determine their effectiveness and performance.
This stage involves rigorous testing, validation, and evaluation of the solutions against predefined criteria and objectives.
Stakeholder feedback may also be collected to refine and enhance the artifacts further.
The primary goal of this phase is to ensure that the designed solutions effectively address the identified problem and meet the intended requirements.

Finally, the Conclusion Phase involves drawing insights and summarizing findings based on the outcomes of the evaluation phase.
Researchers reflect on the effectiveness of the designed artifacts, assess their impact on solving the identified problem, and evaluate their overall contribution to the research objectives.

Each of these \gls{dsr} steps applied to this thesis is mapped and described in the following chapters.
