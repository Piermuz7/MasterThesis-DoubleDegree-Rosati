According to \textcite{SaundersMark2023}, the second layer of the research onion is the research approach, which is the strategy that the researcher can use to start the research.
There are three main research approaches.
\textit{Deductive} approach, that begins with established theories or hypotheses and tests them through empirical data collection, following a structured and logical progression to confirm or refute existing concepts.
In contrast, \textit{inductive} approach involves deriving theories from observed data, allowing patterns and relationships to emerge without predefined expectations.
\textit{Abductive} approach combines elements of both, iteratively moving between theory and data to refine explanations and generate new insights based on surprising observations.

This thesis follows the inductive approach because the aim is to design and develop a system that is based on a data domain, the European research domain.
The data collection to provide this recommendation of collaborators starts with the research questions for analysis, experiments and evaluation of a prototype.
This prototype will be based on a hybrid \gls{ai} approach, the performance of which will be measured by certain evaluation metrics.
The results obtained will be used to prove the thesis statement.
