\chapter{Research Design}\label{chap:research-design}

The research design is the general plan for conducting a study, ensuring that the research questions are addressed effectively.
According to \textcite{SaundersMark2023}, the research design outlines the overall strategy that integrates the different components of the study in a coherent and logical manner, thus ensuring that the study effectively addresses the research question.
Fig.~\ref{fig:research-onion} illustrates the research onion, which provides a structured approach to the conceptualisation of research design by stripping away various layers, including research philosophy, research approach, methodological choice, strategy, time horizon, and data collection techniques and procedures.
This chapter will briefly discuss each of these layers, providing a comprehensive overview of the chosen research design for this study.
