\chapter{A Hybrid AI Architecture for Research Collaboration}\label{chap:Knowledge-DrivenArchitecture}
This chapter presents the architecture of the research collaboration recommender system, which is based on a hybrid \gls{ai} approach.
First of all, the ontology selection process, its description and some examples of subgraphs, are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ontology-selection}.
Then, the recommendation strategy for suggesting both potential collaborators and the creation of consortia, is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:recommendation-strategy}.
Finally, a comprehensive description of the system's architecture design is detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:architecture-design}.
